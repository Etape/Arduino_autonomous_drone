# Arduino_autonomous_drone
The aim of this project is to purpose some primal shape of an autonomous drone controlled by an Arduino UNO card using a IMU MPU9250 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor.

## The Main Materials
1- Arduino Uno card
2- a IMU MPU9250 Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor
3- a couple of Emitter and Receiver Radio
4- 4 Brushless Motors
5- an Adafruit MotorShield V2

## The Goals
In this Project, we are trying to take the full control of the motion of our Drone using just 1 IMU sensor. We are applying theorics explained By [1] on the estimation of the position and the velocity using a IMU MPU9250 sensor.
